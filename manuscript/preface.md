# Preface

This book aims to be accessible to novices, and no prior experience beyond high school mathematics is needed. Thus, this book is written in a way to be self-contained. No programming experience is assumed, however having some kind of programming experience with the functional paradigm could make things easier to grasp in the beginning. After having finished the book I recommend you check the further reading chapter in case you are interested in diving deeper into some of the topics discussed.

I was always curious to understand how things work. As a result, I became very interested in mathematics during high school. One of the reasons for writing this book is that I could not find a book that starts explaining things from scratch, so I had to do a lot of research on the internet through whitepapers, forums, example codes in order to come up with a complete picture on what dependent types are and what they are good for.

Chapters 2, 3, and 4 are introductory chapters for the theory behind Idris, while chapters 5 and 6 are a practical introduction to Idris with examples.

I will consider this book successful if it provides you with some additional knowledge. I tried to write this book so that the definitions and examples provided show how each piece of the puzzle is connected.

Finally, feel free to contact me at buritomath@gmail.com for any questions you might have, and I will do my best to answer. You can also access my blog at https://bor0.wordpress.com to check out some of my latest work.

I hope that you will learn new techniques reading this book, and that it will spark up some more interests for logic, dependent types, and type theory.
