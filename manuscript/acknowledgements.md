# Acknowledgements

Book reviewers:

1. Vlad Riscutia is a software engineer at Microsoft working on Office. He is interested in programming languages and type systems, and how these can best be leveraged to write correct code.
1. Marin Nikolovski is working at Massive Entertainment | A Ubisoft Studio as a Senior Web Developer on UPlay PC. He has over 10 years of experience with designing, developing and testing software across a variety of platforms. He takes pride in coding to consistently high standards and constantly tries to keep up the pace with the latest developments in the IT industry.
1. Neil Mitchell is a Haskell programmer with a PhD in Computer Science from York University, where he worked on making functional programs shorter, faster and safer. Neil is the author of popular Haskell tools such as Hoogle, HLint and Ghcid - all designed to help developers write good code quickly. More recently Neil has been researching build systems with publications at ICFP and the Haskell Symposium, and a practical system based on those ideas named Shake.
1. Nathan Bloomfield did a Ph.D. in algebra at the University of Arkansas and taught mathematics before joining Automattic, Inc. as a programmer. He enjoys witnessing the Intuitionist renaissance and likes how the boring parts of abstract algebra transform into really interesting computer science. Nathan usually feels a little out of his depth and prefers it that way.
