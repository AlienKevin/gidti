# Preface and acknowledgements

This book aims to be accessible to novices that have no prior experience beyond high school mathematics. Thus, this book is designed to be self-contained. No programming experience is assumed, however having some kind of programming experience with the functional programming paradigm could make things easier to grasp in the beginning. After you finish reading the book I recommend that you check the "Further reading" chapter in case you are interested in diving deeper into some of the topics discussed.

I was always curious to understand how things work. As a result, I became very interested in mathematics while I was at high school. One of the reasons for writing this book is that I could not find a book that explained how things work, so I had to do a lot of research on the internet through white-papers, forums, and example code in order to come up with a complete picture of what dependent types are and what they are good for.

I will consider this book successful if it provides you with some additional knowledge. I tried to write this book so that the definitions and examples provided in it show how different pieces of the puzzle are connected to each other.

Feel free to contact me at buritomath@gmail.com for any questions you might have, and I will do my best to answer. You can also access my blog at bor0.wordpress.com to check out some of my latest work.

Book reviewers:

1. Nathan Bloomfield did a Ph.D. in algebra at the University of Arkansas and taught mathematics before joining Automattic, Inc. as a programmer. He enjoys witnessing the Intuitionist renaissance and likes how the boring parts of abstract algebra transform into really interesting computer science. Nathan usually feels a little out of his depth and prefers it that way.
1. Vlad Riscutia is a software engineer at Microsoft working on Office. He is interested in programming languages and type systems, and how these can best be leveraged to write correct code.
1. Marin Nikolovski is working at Massive Entertainment | A Ubisoft Studio as a Senior Web Developer on UPlay PC. He has over 10 years of experience with designing, developing and testing software across a variety of platforms. He takes pride in coding to consistently high standards and constantly tries to keep up the pace with the latest developments in the IT industry.
1. Neil Mitchell is a Haskell programmer with a PhD in Computer Science from York University, where he worked on making functional programs shorter, faster and safer. Neil is the author of popular Haskell tools such as Hoogle, HLint and Ghcid - all designed to help developers write good code quickly. More recently Neil has been researching build systems with publications at ICFP and the Haskell Symposium, and a practical system based on those ideas named Shake.

Thanks to my family, coworkers, and friends for all the support they give to me.

Finally, thank you for purchasing this book! I hope that you will learn new techniques reading this book, and that it will spark up some more interests for logic, dependent types, and type theory.
